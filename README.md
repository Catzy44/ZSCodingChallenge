Przemys≈Çaw Witczak - Recruitment Task for S.R.

I used the basic tools I work with on a daily basis:
- Eclipse
- Gradle
- Project Lombok
- JUnit

Following TDD, as described in the instructions, I first created blind tests for the entire architecture and only then moved on to the implementation. 
Naturally, the tests were later adjusted, since there were minor changes to the initial concept, as well as a few small oversights on my part.

The instructions did not mention a main method, but I decided to include it to provide a final look at the program's output.
